## I was the first to explore how gaze-contingent rendering of binocular disparities could improve depth perception in virtual and augmented reality. [Gordon Wetzstein's group](http://www.computationalimaging.org/publications/gaze-contingent-ocular-parallax-rendering-for-virtual-reality/) have since published experimental work.
