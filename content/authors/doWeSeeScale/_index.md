## If all of our visual cues to scale are ineffective (vergence, accommodation, motion parallax, vertical disparities), limited in application (ground plane), or merely cognitive (familiar size), we should be open to the idea that the visual system does not extract absolute size and distance from the environment, and that visual scale is entirely cognitive and post-perceptual.
