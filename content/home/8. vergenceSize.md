# Size Perception

## In Linton, P. (2020). ['Eye Movements Do Not Affect Perceived Size'](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.23.961649v2), _BioRxiv_ (under review), I show that eye movements are not used for size constancy (perceiving objects as a constant physical size despite changes in distance). This work is explained in my [Vision Sciences Society](https://www.visionsciences.org/) poster.
